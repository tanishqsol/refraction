            The Refraction Certificate Examination is made up of five ten 10 minute OSCE stations. In each station
            candidates input their calculated answers using an application on an iPad.<br><br>

            In order to make the examination as straight forward as possible we have produced a practice application so
            that you can familiarise yourself with it.<br><br>

            Please note the running timer for each station which automatically shuts off after ten minutes. Any
            information you have entered is automatically saved.<br><br>

            If you are using an iPad for this practice test remember to turn it into portrait mode before the test
            starts.
